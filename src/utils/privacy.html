      Personal Data: We collect personal data that you provide to us, including
      your name and email address. Usage Data: We collect data related to your
      use of our app, such as tasks, time spent on tasks, and analytics. Payment
      Data: For users who choose our "Plus" tier, we collect payment information
      through Apple Pay or credit card. However, we do not store or process this

    <h2>Security of Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      We prioritize the security of your data. Your password is hashed, ensuring

    </p>
    <h2>Payment Information</h2>
    <p>
      All payment-related processes are encrypted and securely handled by our
      payment processors. We do not have access to your credit card details or
